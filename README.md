#  Quantifying Pressure in Cricket for building Expected Runs model

![Flowchart of proposed model](https://github.com/Rit-ctrl/Pressure-Quantification-for-Cricket/blob/main/flowchart.pdf)

- Utilise LSTM model to build pressure index
- Combine this with current state variables to predict runs scored
